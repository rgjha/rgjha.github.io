    <p> <font size="+2"> Interested in nature, computation, and computability of nature. </font> </p>

    I am postdoc at <a href="https://www.jlab.org">Jefferson Lab</a> working on continuous variable (CV) approach to quantum computing. Before this position, I spent three years at Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Canada 
    where my mentor was Pedro Vieira who is an expert in supersymetric gauge theories and S-matrix bootstrap methods. 
    I completed my Ph.D. from Syracuse University in 2019 working with Simon Catterall on various aspects of 
    lattice field theory especially application to thermodynamics of black holes in supergravity.   


    <h6 class="w3-wide w3-center"> (Last updated: 03 March, 2023, see <a href="raghav_jha_cv.pdf">CV</a> here) </h4>

    My research interests cover several exciting areas of theoretical Physics. 
    At the beginning of my Ph.D., I worked exclusively on supersymmetric gauge theories as 
    non-perturbative formulations of string theory through the gauge/gravity duality. 
    In this area, I am particularly interested in the study of the finite-temperature 
    maximally supersymmetric gauge theories using Monte Carlo (MC) methods to check and predict 
    results about non-extremal black p-branes in the dual supergravity (SUGRA). 
    This numerical approach provides a tool for potential non-trivial checks 
    of the AdS/CFT conjecture.  

  </p> 

    In Fall 2018, I started working on tensor network renormalization group 
    methods to study lower-dimensional gauge theories 
    and spin models with continuous or discrete symmetries. 
    Since the tensor network methods are computationally expensive in higher dimensions, 
    one of my other recent interests is also to explore different algorithms 
    which will enable us to study a wide class of 
    statistical models with sufficient accuracy. 
    A long-term goal is to compute critical exponents in 3d 
    models by going close to the QFT limit and comparing it to the results 
    from the well-established conformal bootstrap program and MC methods. 
    Another direction is to study models which are affected by sign problems 
    in conventional Monte Carlo methods, such as those at finite chemical potential 
    or with topological term.  


  </p>

    During my postdoc at Perimeter, I started exploring alternate methods to 
    understand matrix models (through bootstrap). I also became part of a small 
    collaboration trying to understand the scattering in Ising Field Theory (IFT) 
    using MPS methods. Due to increased interest across the world related to 
    quantum architectures and its potential applications, in the last several years, I have explored 
    QISKIT (pronounced kiss-kit), Cirq, and PennyLane to model simple physical 
    systems on available/near-term quantum devices and applications of quantum 
    computation (or more formally -- classical/quantum (hybrid) NISQ based algorithms) 
    to quantum many-body problems. Quantum computation and especially a proper 
    understanding of digitization of gauge and spin models is one of the problems I am exploring in my 
    second postdoc. Our goal is mostly focused on the continuous variable (CV) approach to 
    quantum computing. In this approach, unlike the qubits, the quantum information and 
    unitary transformations are written in terms of bosonic operators which have infinite-
    dimensional Hilbert space. If you like to read more about quantum computing (very basic level)
    and CV approach, please refer to the my recent review article --  
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09679"> here </a>

    <h2 class="w3-wide w3-center"> DATA SCIENCE STUFF </h2>

    Apart from Physics, I am interested in data science especially supervised and unsupervised machine learning. 
    A small collection of sample projects I have done are given below.

  </p>
     Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of retrieving, processing, and 'knowing' the data. It makes full use of a famous DS/ML slogan - Visualize!!
     Here, I present few examples from the projects I have done. For example, the first two figures are taken from the analysis of my own flight data (i.e., flight routes taken since 2009). It is obvious that I have spent major part of these 14 years traveling between India and where I did PhD (New York) and postdoc (Toronto). Unfortunately, I have not been to the southern hemisphere but crossed the Date Line several times. In the next figure, we see
     about 1200 years of data predicting the day when the cherry will blossom in Kyoto, Japan. This project was inspired by a paper published which
     studied the effect of global warming on this annual event. The next figure shows the histogram for the comparison of various statistical measures such -- Accuracy, F1 Score, Precision, Recall (attributes from the confusion matrix) for different algorithms. I mostly use Matplotlib, Plotly, and Seaborn for data visualization. I have carried out these EDA mostly on Jupyter notebooks, Google Colab, or on GCP.

    NLP is the field of data science/machine learning related to the analysis of texts, speech and drawing meaningful conclusions from it. 
    In fact, advanced NLP models based on AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) can also suggest texts and answer questions based on 
    trained models. This is why with Chat-GPT, the interest in LLM (large language models) have considerably increased. Below we see
    a snapshot of the project involving the determination of whether a message is spam or not and glimpse of processing of such 
    written texts. 

    The packages I have used for NLP problems are the NL tool-kit (NLTK) (it is a leading platform for building Python 
    programs to work with human language data) and spaCy. In the first figure, we see one step of how we clean the data 
    through various columns based on removing punctuations, stop words, stemming/lemmatization, and tokenization. 
    In the second figure, we see a word cloud of the papers written in Quantum Physics during the 1990s obtained from the dataset 
    from arXiv preprint server, a short project I did to bring out the physicist in me!

    One of the most popular unsupervised learning algorithms is k-means clustering. The goal of k-means is 
    to group data points into distinct non-overlapping subgroups. This is very useful for problems like 
    customer segmentation. In the first figure, we show an example based on k-means algorithm with five clusters
    for a problem related to how people (customers) in some mall spend their money. The choice of number of clusters
    is crucial since it can lead to overfitting (high variance) for large 'k' and will underfit for small 'k'. 
    A method for making a good choice is the elbow method. 
    

    In the second figure, we show one of the simplest CNN architecture known as 'LeNet' network (deep learning).  
    It consists of repeating convolution and pooling layers before the fully dense layer and logit output.
    This can be used to identify a hand-drawn "8" [as shown] with good accuracy. In the last figure, we 
    classify the single-channel (no RGB) fashion dataset image with deep learning models in PyTorch.
