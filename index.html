								<h2 class="major">About</h2>

                                Hi! I am postdoc at <a href="https://www.jlab.org">Jefferson Lab</a> working on various aspects of quantum computing including both qubit-based and qumodes-based approaches to universal quantum computing. My position is funded by C2QA which is one of the five Quantum Information Science (QIS) Research Centers established by the US Department of Energy (DOE). The goal is to work toward quantum advantage in computations for nuclear physics, chemistry, materials science, and condensed matter physics. 

                                <span class="image main"><img src="gallery/photo1.jpeg"/></span>

                                Before this position, I spent three years at Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Canada where my mentor was Pedro Vieira. I completed my PhD from Syracuse University working with Simon Catterall on various aspects of lattice field theory especially application to understanding the thermodynamics of higher-dimensional black holes in supergravity.  


                                </p>

                                I grew up in different states of India (Darbhanga, Bihar from 1993 until 1999, Delhi from 1999 until 2001, and Sonipat, Haryana from 2001 until 2007) and studied for my Bachelors degree in Physics at
                                <a href="https://www.ststephens.edu">St. Stephen's College, Delhi</a> while being a KVPY Scholar. In 2010, I received a 1-year scholarship from European Union to study for MS at University of Paris (now Sorbonne Universite). I did research on trilayer graphene using ab-initio density functional theory calculations. I then moved back to India and completed another MSc in Astroparticle Physics from Bose Institute and St. Xavier's College (2011-2013) and wrote my MSc thesis on Markov Chain Monte Carlo for path integral approach to QFTs. In my final year of MSc, I was awarded the CSIR/UGC fellowship by Government of India. 

                                In 2013, I joined the Physics department of Syracuse University
                                and obtained my PhD in 2019. Later that year, I moved to Waterloo, Canada for 
                                my first postdoc and returned to US for my second postdoc in 2022.

								<h2 class="major">Research</h2>
								
									My research interests cover several exciting areas of Theoretical Physics. 
    							During the beginning of my PhD, I worked mostly on supersymmetric gauge theories as 
    							non-perturbative formulations of string theory through the gauge/gravity duality. 
    							In this area, I am particularly interested in the study of the finite-temperature 
    							maximally supersymmetric gauge theories using Monte Carlo (MC) methods to check and predict 
    							results about non-extremal black p-branes in the dual supergravity (SUGRA). 
    							This numerical approach provides a tool for potential non-trivial checks 
    							of the AdS/CFT conjecture.  

  								</p> 

    							In 2018, I started exploring tensor network renormalization group 
    							methods to study lower-dimensional gauge theories 
   							  and spin models with continuous or discrete symmetries. 
    							Since the tensor network methods are computationally expensive in higher dimensions, 
    							one of my other recent interests is also to explore different algorithms 
    							which will enable us to study a wide class of 
    							statistical models with sufficient accuracy. 
    							A long-term goal is to compute critical exponents in 3d 
    							models by going close to the QFT limit and comparing it to the results 
    							from the well-established conformal bootstrap program and MC methods. 
    							Another direction is to study models which are affected by sign problems 
    							in conventional Monte Carlo methods, such as those at finite chemical potential 
    							or with topological term.  
    


  								</p>

    							During my postdoc at Perimeter, I started exploring alternate methods to 
   								understand matrix models (through bootstrap). I also became part of a small 
    							collaboration trying to understand the scattering in Ising Field Theory (IFT) 
    							using MPS methods. Due to increased interest across the world related to 
    							quantum architectures and its potential applications, in the last several years, I have explored 
    							QISKIT (pronounced kiss-kit), Cirq, and PennyLane to model simple physical 
    							systems on available/near-term quantum devices and applications of quantum 
    							computation (or more formally -- classical/quantum (hybrid) NISQ based algorithms) 
    							to quantum many-body problems. Quantum computation and especially a proper 
    							understanding of digitization of gauge and spin models is one of the problems I am exploring in my 
    							second postdoc. Our goal is mostly focused on the continuous variable (CV) approach to 
    							quantum computing. In this approach, unlike the qubits, the quantum information and 
    							unitary transformations are written in terms of bosonic operators which have infinite-
    							dimensional Hilbert space (suitably truncated). If you like to read more about quantum computing 
    							including the CV approach, please refer to the my recent review article --  
    							<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09679"> here </a>. Some of the material in this article 
    							is based on lectures given at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) Summer School 
    							in June 2022, Hampton University Graduate Studies (HUGS) program and 
    							Quantum Computing Bootcamp at Jefferson Lab in June 2023. 


  						</p>

  						<div class="box">
							FOR STUDENTS: Please contact if you would like to know more about my work and want do a research project. 
    					Unfortunately, until I get a permanent position, I won't be able to write reference letters. 
    					If this is acceptable and you are interested, I would be happy to chat and discuss. I have wide collection of projects related to lattice gauge theory, tensor networks, qubits and qumodes approach to quantum computing, computational complexity theory, variational algorithms such as
    					conventional VQE and d-sparse VQE, Hamiltonian simulation, scrambling in randomly coupled 
    					systems and some others.

								<h2 class="major">Data Science Stuff</h2>   
    <ol>

    	Apart from Physics, I am interested in data science especially supervised and unsupervised machine learning. 
    A small collection of sample projects I have done are given below. 

     <font size="+0"> 
    <ol>
  <li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-link active" data-toggle="tab" href="https://www.github.com/rgjha" role="tablist" > <font size="+2"> EDA and Data Visualization </font>    <i class="fa fa-bar-chart" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> 

  </p>
     Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of retrieving, processing, and 'knowing' the data. It makes full use of a famous DS/ML slogan - Visualize!!
     Here, I present few examples from the projects I have done. For example, the first two figures are taken from the analysis of my own flight data (i.e., flight routes taken since 2009). It is obvious that I have spent major part of these 14 years traveling between India and where I did PhD (New York) and postdoc (Toronto). Unfortunately, I have not been to the southern hemisphere but crossed the Date Line several times. In the next figure, we see
     about 1200 years of data predicting the day when the cherry will blossom in Kyoto, Japan. This project was inspired by a paper published which
     studied the effect of global warming on this annual event. The next figure shows the histogram for the comparison of various statistical measures such -- Accuracy, F1 Score, Precision, Recall (attributes from the confusion matrix) for different algorithms. I mostly use Matplotlib, Plotly, and Seaborn for data visualization. I have carried out these EDA mostly on Jupyter notebooks, Google Colab, or on GCP.

    NLP is the field of data science/machine learning related to the analysis of texts, speech and drawing meaningful conclusions from it. 
    In fact, advanced NLP models based on AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) can also suggest texts and answer questions based on 
    trained models. This is why with Chat-GPT, the interest in LLM (large language models) have considerably increased. Below we see
    a snapshot of the project involving the determination of whether a message is spam or not and glimpse of processing of such 
    written texts. 

    The packages I have used for NLP problems are the NL tool-kit (NLTK) (it is a leading platform for building Python 
    programs to work with human language data) and spaCy. In the first figure, we see one step of how we clean the data 
    through various columns based on removing punctuations, stop words, stemming/lemmatization, and tokenization. 
    In the second figure, we see a word cloud of the papers written in Quantum Physics during the 1990s obtained from the dataset 
    from arXiv preprint server, a short project I did to bring out the physicist in me!

    One of the most popular unsupervised learning algorithms is k-means clustering. The goal of k-means is 
    to group data points into distinct non-overlapping subgroups. This is very useful for problems like 
    customer segmentation. In the first figure, we show an example based on k-means algorithm with five clusters
    for a problem related to how people (customers) in some mall spend their money. The choice of number of clusters
    is crucial since it can lead to overfitting (high variance) for large 'k' and will underfit for small 'k'. 
    A method for making a good choice is the elbow method. 
    

    In the second figure, we show one of the simplest CNN architecture known as 'LeNet' network (deep learning).  
    It consists of repeating convolution and pooling layers before the fully dense layer and logit output.
    This can be used to identify a hand-drawn "8" [as shown] with good accuracy. In the last figure, we 
    classify the single-channel (no RGB) fashion dataset image with deep learning models in PyTorch.
